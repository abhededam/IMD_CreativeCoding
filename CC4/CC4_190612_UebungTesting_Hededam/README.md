Automated Testing
=================

Please look at the examples "email", "scraper-example" and "temperature".

Then take a stab at implementing your own code that is based on provided tests (Aufgabe1-TDD) and finish this off by writing your own tests for an existing codebase (Aufgabe2-Tests).

Also try to show where the "email" example falls short. What email addresses does it classify wrongly? Can you fix some of those cases?

Hints
-----

1. Every Directory should contain its own README file! Sometimes, there's more
   info in those.

2. You'll need node.js and NPM (comes with node.js). If this gives you trouble
   take a look at last semester's materials.

3. Make liberal use of the provided help (read: Our nice Tutor!)

4. We're using mocha, but there's about 100 other test frameworks out there.
   This is by no means an endorsement.

5. Since you need mocha, i'll also tell you how to install it:
   `npm install -g mocha`.
